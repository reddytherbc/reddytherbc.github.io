## 2	What information does BaoViet Go collect and access when it is in use and why?
When you sign up for BaoViet Go , it is clearly indicated that BaoViet Go requires access to certain information. The type of information, the reasons why BaoViet Go requires access to them and the time at which the information is accessed are set out below:
- Location Information – This is to enable BaoViet Go to detect your acceleration, cornering, speed, braking and other measurements which make for safe driving and to provide you with discounts and rewards under your motor insurance policy. It is therefore necessary for permission to be given through the permission system of your mobile operating system for BaoViet Go to be used for its main purpose of assessing your performance as a driver. You should allow the ‘Always’ Location permission, if requested.
- Sensors Motion Detection – To record the safety measurements of your driving (accelerating, cornering, speed, braking), BaoViet Go needs to access the activity recognition functionality of your mobile phone’s operating system. 
- Network/Wifi states – BaoViet Go collects the location information in real time whilst you are connected via your mobile operator’s network or Wifi. However, if that connection is interrupted, the information is stored locally in your mobile phone until a connection is available. It is therefore necessary for permission to be given for BaoViet Go to access your network or Wifi information through your mobile operating system to obtain the information collected by the app and stored in your mobile.
- Mobile phone usage data – BaoViet Go collects mobile phone usage  data while driving (i.e. information about when you make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages on your device).
