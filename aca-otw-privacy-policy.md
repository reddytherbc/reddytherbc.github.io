## 2	What information does ACA OTW collect and access when it is in use and why?
When you sign up for ACA OTW , it is clearly indicated that ACA OTW requires access to certain information. The type of information, the reasons why ACA OTW requires access to them and the time at which the information is accessed are set out below:
- Location Information – This is to enable ACA OTW to detect your acceleration, cornering, speed, braking and other measurements which make for safe driving and to provide you with discounts and rewards under your motor insurance policy. It is therefore necessary for permission to be given through the permission system of your mobile operating system for ACA OTW to be used for its main purpose of assessing your performance as a driver. You should allow the ‘Always’ Location permission, if requested.
- Sensors Motion Detection – To record the safety measurements of your driving (accelerating, cornering, speed, braking), ACA OTW needs to access the activity recognition functionality of your mobile phone’s operating system. 
- Network/Wifi states – ACA OTW collects the location information in real time whilst you are connected via your mobile operator’s network or Wifi. However, if that connection is interrupted, the information is stored locally in your mobile phone until a connection is available. It is therefore necessary for permission to be given for ACA OTW to access your network or Wifi information through your mobile operating system to obtain the information collected by the app and stored in your mobile.
- Mobile phone usage data – ACA OTW collects mobile phone usage  data while driving (i.e. information about when you make and receive phone calls and send and receive text messages on your device).
- Bluetooth data – ACA OTW collects information about the Bluetooth device that you are connected to while recording the journey to determine whether you are driving and/or determine which vehicle you are driving.
